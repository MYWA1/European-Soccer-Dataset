# European-Soccer-Dataset
# Introduction
This is a brief introduction to my project which is based on dataset from European soccer data. The dataset is quite extensive with different tables like (Team, Country, League, Match, Player, Player_Attribute, Team_Attribute).

Questions: With this dataset, i'd like to answer questions like:

What team has the best defensive record (clean sheet)?
What League has the most goals?
What team has the best home & Away record (Most Wins)
Is there a relationship between the best defensive record and the best win record?
